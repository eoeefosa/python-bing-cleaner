Hello and welcome to WickedBinge, where we rank your favorite characters from good to evil. Today we're diving into the underwater world of SpongeBob SquarePants and taking a look at one of the most controversial characters in the show: Mr. Krabs.

Mr. Krabs is the owner and founder of the Krusty Krab, the most successful restaurant in Bikini Bottom. He is also the employer of SpongeBob and Squidward, and the father of Pearl. He is obsessed with money and will do anything to make more of it, even if it means exploiting his employees, customers, friends, and family. He has a long-standing rivalry with his former best friend, Plankton, who owns the failing Chum Bucket restaurant across the street and constantly tries to steal the secret formula of the Krabby Patty, the most popular and delicious burger in Bikini Bottom.

But is Mr. Krabs really as bad as he seems? Or does he have a hidden heart of gold? In this video, we'll rank Mr. Krabs' actions from good to evil, based on how they affect others and himself. We'll also look at some of his motivations and backstory, and see how they shape his personality. Let's get started!

[GOOD]

We'll start with some of Mr. Krabs' good deeds, which are few and far between, but still worth mentioning.

- Public Service: Before he became a restaurateur, Mr. Krabs was in the Navy serving as a janitor. This commitment to public service seems out of character for Mr. Krabs, but it shows that he was willing to do something for the greater good at some point in his life. It also gave him some valuable skills and experience that he later used in his business ventures.

- Self-Made: Mr. Krabs did not grow up with money. He came from a poor family and had to work hard to achieve his dreams. He planned from the time he was young for his success and was able to rise above all expectations for him to accomplish his goals. He also built the Krusty Krab from scratch, using an old boat that he bought for a bargain.

- Forgiving: Mr. Krabs has shown some mercy and compassion towards those who have wronged him in the past. He has forgiven SpongeBob and Squidward for their mistakes and mishaps, even when they cost him money or customers. He has also given Plankton several chances to redeem himself, despite their bitter rivalry.

- Loving: Mr. Krabs does love his daughter Pearl very much, even though he doesn't always understand her or show it properly. He tries to make her happy and give her what she wants, even if it means spending money or sacrificing his own happiness. He also cares for his mother Betsy, who raised him alone after his father left.

- Generous: On rare occasions, Mr. Krabs has shown some generosity and kindness towards others. He has donated money to charity, given free food to customers, helped out his friends in need, and even shared some of his secrets with SpongeBob.

[EVIL]

Now we'll move on to some of Mr. Krabs' evil deeds, which are much more common and severe than his good ones.

- Greedy: Mr. Krabs is incredibly greedy and selfish. He values money above all else and will do anything to make more of it or save it from being spent. He regularly takes shortcuts and cheats his way to success, without caring about the consequences or the harm he causes to others or himself.

- Abusive: Mr. Krabs is very abusive towards his employees, especially SpongeBob and Squidward. He pays them very low wages (or none at all), forces them to work long hours without breaks or benefits, makes them do dangerous or humiliating tasks, threatens them with violence or termination if they disobey him or complain, and takes credit for their work.

- Exploitative: Mr. Krabs is also very exploitative towards his customers and suppliers. He charges them exorbitant prices for low-quality food and service, tricks them into buying more than they need or want, uses cheap or harmful ingredients in his products (such as expired meat or jellyfish jelly), lies about his promotions or policies (such
